    <p>A large part of my research focuses on understanding the process of structure formation in the Universe, and using it to inform our models of fundmental physics. This field of research can help some of the most interesting open problems in all of physics, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is the nature of Dark Energy that drives the accelerated expansion of our Universe?</li>
        <li>What is the microphysical nature of Dark Matter, that makes up 80% of the total matter content in the Universe?</li>
    </ul>
