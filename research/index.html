    <p>A large part of my research focuses on understanding the process of structure formation in the Universe, and using it to inform our models of fundmental physics. Here are some of the specific questions and techniques I have worked on:</p>
    <h3>Neutrino mass</h3>
    <p>Neutrinos are the lightest Standard Model particles, but the number density of relic neutrinos from the early Universe are high enough that they start affecting the formation and growth of structure in the Universe. The size of the effect on various cosmological observables is directly proportional to the total mass of the three neutrino mass eigenstates. Turning this around, precise measurements from cosmology can help constrain the neutrino mass. This is going to be one of the main targets for upcoming cosmological surveys. In this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07126">paper</a>, we investigated how well the neutrino masses can be constrained by combining measurements on large scales (where linear perturbation theory is valid) from two of these experiments, the <a href="https://www.lsst.org/about">LSST</a> at <a href="https://www.vro.org/">VRO</a>, and the CMB-S4 experiment.</p>

             <p>To fully capture the effect of neutrino mass, down to scales where the structure formation process is nonlinear, neutrinos need to be actively modeled in high resolution N-body simulations. I helped develop two numerical techniques (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06167">here</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03906">here</a>), which can track the full nonlinear evolution in massive neutrino cosmologies without suffering from discreteness issues plaguing some of the other methods. These advances in simulation methods are crucial for harnessing the information on neutrino mass from nonlinear scales in various surveys.</p> 
             <p>Neutrinos also produce unique signatures on the clustering of nonlinear objects, like Dark Matter halos, and highly empty regions, called voids.</p>
