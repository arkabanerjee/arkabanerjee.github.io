	<h1>Welcome to my homepage!</h1>
	<p>I'm a cosmologist and currently a KIPAC fellow at the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (<a href="https://kipac.stanford.edu/">KIPAC</a>) at Stanford University and SLAC National Accelerator and Laboratory. My research focuses primarily on the connections between fundamental physics at microscopic scales, and the formation and evolution of the structures we can see (and not see) in the Universe. You can find more details about my research <a href="/research">here</a>.</p>
	<p>I received my undegraduate degree in Physics from <a href="https://www.ststephens.edu/">St. Stephen's College</a>, in Delhi, India, and my Master's degree from the <a href="https://www.tifr.res.in/">Tata Institute for Fundamental Research</a>a>, in Mumbai, India.</p>
